gtag('event', 'lead_submit', {
  business_id: businessId,
  business_name: businessName,
  suburb: businessSuburb,
  category: businessCategory,
  source: 'profile_form',
  currency: 'AUD',
  value: 50, // Estimated lead value
  user_type: 'resident'
});

// Social sharing actions
gtag('event', 'share_click', {
  platform: 'facebook', // facebook, twitter, linkedin, copy
  business_id: businessId,
  business_name: businessName,
