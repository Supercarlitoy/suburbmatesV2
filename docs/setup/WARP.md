### Development Guidelines

#### Database Changes ‚úÖ DIRECTORY ADMIN COMPLIANT
1. Always modify `prisma/schema.prisma` first
2. Run `npx prisma generate` to update client
3. Use `npx prisma db push` for schema changes in development
4. Create proper migrations for production
5. Run `npm run validate:domain` to check for SSOT compliance

**Directory Admin Schema Features:**
- **Business Visibility Rules:** Only `approvalStatus = 'APPROVED'` appear in public
- **Badge Logic:** "Verified" badge only when `abnStatus = 'VERIFIED'`
- **Quality Scoring:** 0-100 algorithm based on completeness, recency, reviews
- **Deduplication:** Strict (phone/domain/name+suburb) and loose (Levenshtein) matching
- **Audit Trail:** All administrative actions logged with metadata

**Enhanced Database Models (Complete Admin Spec):**
- **Core Entities:**
  - `User`: Authenticated account holders (USER/ADMIN roles) who own/manage Business profiles
  - `Customer`: Unauthenticated prospective clients (stored in Lead/Inquiry models)
  - `Business`: Core entity with comprehensive admin fields:
    - Status: `abnStatus` (NOT_PROVIDED | PENDING | VERIFIED | INVALID | EXPIRED)
    - Approval: `approvalStatus` (PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED) - default PENDING
    - Origin: `source` (MANUAL | CSV | AUTO_ENRICH | CLAIMED)
    - Quality: `qualityScore` (0-100 algorithm: completeness 40% + recency 20% + reviews 20% + verification 20%)
    - Duplicates: `duplicateOfId` self-referencing for duplicate management
    - Ownership: `ownerId` optional (users can own multiple businesses)
- **Lead Management:**
  - `Lead`: Status tracking (NEW ‚Üí CONTACTED ‚Üí QUALIFIED ‚Üí CONVERTED ‚Üí CLOSED)
  - `Inquiry`: Enhanced lead capture with UTM tracking, AI qualification, marketing attribution
- **Verification Systems:**
  - `OwnershipClaim`: Multi-method verification (EMAIL_DOMAIN | PHONE_OTP | DOCUMENT)
  - `AuditLog`: Complete activity trails with actor tracking and metadata
  - `FeatureFlag`: Dynamic A/B testing and gradual feature rollout
