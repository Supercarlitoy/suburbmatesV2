## Running Tests

### Quick Health Check
```bash
# Run the comprehensive smoke test suite
npx playwright test smoke-test-suite.spec.ts
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests across all browsers
npx playwright test

# Run specific test category
npx playwright test business-workflows.spec.ts
npx playwright test admin-panel.spec.ts
npx playwright test api-endpoints.spec.ts
```

### Development Testing
```bash
# Run tests in headed mode for development
npx playwright test --headed

# Run tests with debug output
npx playwright test --debug
```

### CI/CD Testing
```bash
# Run tests in CI mode (with retries and artifacts)
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

## Test Configuration

### Browser Coverage
Tests run across **5 different browsers/devices**:
- **Desktop Chrome** (Chromium)
- **Desktop Firefox** 
- **Desktop Safari** (WebKit)
- **Mobile Chrome** (Pixel 5)
- **Mobile Safari** (iPhone 14 Pro)

### Test Environment
- **Base URL**: Configurable via `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`
- **Local Development**: Auto-starts dev server on `localhost:3000`
- **Production Testing**: Points to deployed application
- **Parallel Execution**: Full parallel support for CI/CD

### Artifact Collection
- **Screenshots**: On test failure
- **Videos**: Disabled by default (configurable)
- **Traces**: Retained on failure for debugging
- **HTML Reports**: Generated for CI/CD

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
The platform includes automated testing in CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: npx playwright test
  env:
    CI: true
- name: Upload test artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: failure()
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

### Test Execution Strategy
1. **Build Verification**: Ensures application builds successfully
2. **Test Execution**: Runs comprehensive test suite
3. **Artifact Collection**: Collects failure reports and screenshots
4. **Status Reporting**: Provides detailed test results

## Melbourne-Specific Testing

The test suite includes specialized testing for Melbourne business features:

### Location-Based Functionality
- Melbourne suburb search and filtering
- Business category validation
- Service area mapping

### Local Business Features
- Australian business classification testing
- Melbourne metropolitan area focus
- Suburb-specific search validation

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Checks
- **Platform Health**: Core page availability
- **API Health**: Service endpoint monitoring  
- **Email Health**: Communication system status
- **Database Health**: Data layer connectivity

### Performance Monitoring
- **Page Load Times**: Performance regression detection
- **API Response Times**: Service performance tracking
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: System stability metrics

## Test Data Strategy

### Safe Testing Approach
- **No Real Data Creation**: Tests avoid creating production data
- **Mock Interactions**: Form validation without submission
- **Test-Specific Routes**: Using test business IDs and paths
- **Error Condition Testing**: Validates error handling

### Test Business Data
- Test business IDs: `test-business-123`, `test-business-456`
- Test claim routes: `/claim/test-business-*`
- Test profile routes: `/business/test-*`

## Debugging and Development

### Test Development Workflow
1. **Write Test**: Create new test in appropriate file
2. **Run Locally**: Test with `npx playwright test --headed`
3. **Debug Issues**: Use `--debug` flag for step-by-step execution
4. **Validate CI**: Ensure tests pass in GitHub Actions

### Common Debugging Techniques
- **Console Logging**: All tests include descriptive console output
- **Element Inspection**: Tests verify UI elements are present
- **Network Monitoring**: API tests validate request/response cycles
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with informative messages

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Update Test Data**: Refresh test business IDs as needed
- **Browser Updates**: Keep Playwright browsers current
- **Flaky Test Management**: Monitor and fix unstable tests
- **Performance Baselines**: Update performance expectations

### Test Coverage Goals
- **‚úÖ 100% Critical Path Coverage**: All essential user journeys tested
- **‚úÖ Cross-Browser Compatibility**: All major browsers and devices
- **‚úÖ API Contract Testing**: All public APIs validated  
- **‚úÖ Error Condition Testing**: Failure scenarios covered
