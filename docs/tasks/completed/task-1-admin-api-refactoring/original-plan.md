# üéØ Admin API Layer Refactoring - Complete Implementation Plan

**Project Code:** SUBM-ADMIN-001  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Estimated Duration:** 8 Days  
**Team:** Backend Development  

## üö® PROBLEM STATEMENT

**Current Issue:** Mixed architecture where admin API routes inconsistently use service layer vs. direct Prisma queries, preventing full utilization of sophisticated backend services.

**Evidence Found:**
- ‚úÖ `/api/admin/businesses/approve/route.ts` - Uses service layer properly  
- ‚ùå `/api/admin/businesses/route.ts` - Direct Prisma queries only
- ‚ùå `/api/admin/businesses/[businessId]/route.ts` - Direct Prisma with minimal service integration

**Backend Services Available:**
- `approval-workflow.ts` - Full approval logic with AI scoring ‚úÖ
- `quality-scoring.ts` - 0-100 quality algorithm ‚úÖ  
- `duplicate-detection.ts` - Strict/loose matching ‚úÖ
- `ai-automation.ts` - AI verification with 75% confidence threshold ‚úÖ
- `abn-verification.ts` - Australian Business Number validation ‚úÖ
- `csv-operations.ts` - Bulk import/export operations ‚úÖ
