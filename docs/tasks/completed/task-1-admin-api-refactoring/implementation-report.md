## üõ† Maintenance Guidelines

### Service Layer Best Practices
1. **Always use services**: Never bypass the service layer for admin operations
2. **Configure enhancements**: Use options to control expensive operations (AI, duplicates)
3. **Handle errors gracefully**: Services include comprehensive error handling
4. **Audit everything**: All admin actions are automatically logged

### Adding New Admin Features
```typescript
// Example: Adding new admin functionality
const adminService = new AdminBusinessService(prisma);

// Get enhanced business data
const business = await adminService.getBusinessForAdmin(businessId, {
  includeQualityScore: true,
  includeDuplicates: false, // Skip expensive operations if not needed
  includeAIAnalysis: true
});

// Log admin action
await adminService.logAdminAccess(
  'NEW_ADMIN_ACTION',
  businessId,
  adminUserId,
  { /* metadata */ },
  ipAddress,
  userAgent
);
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use selective enhancement options to avoid unnecessary computations
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed admin statistics
- Monitor service layer performance and optimize as needed
