## Business Logic Implementation

### AI Analysis Algorithms

**Completeness Analysis:**
- Required field validation (name, phone, email, suburb, category)
- Optional field scoring (website, address, bio, ABN)
- Weighted scoring system (15 points per required, 6.25 per optional)
- Recommendation generation based on completion levels

**Data Quality Analysis:**
- Email format validation with suspicious domain detection
- Australian phone number format validation
- Website URL validation with redirect detection
- ABN format validation (11-digit Australian format)
- Business name validation with placeholder detection
- Content quality assessment with spam pattern detection

**Business Legitimacy Analysis:**
- ABN verification status assessment
- Contact method verification simulation
- Website legitimacy heuristics
- Location verification through coordinate checking
- Activity pattern analysis (inquiries, leads, engagement)
- Source reliability assessment (MANUAL vs CSV vs AUTO_ENRICH)

**Content Moderation:**
- Spam pattern detection with extensive keyword library
- Profanity detection with severity assessment
- Excessive capitalization and punctuation detection
- Content quality scoring with deduction system
- Social media and promotional content filtering

**Duplicate Detection:**
- Multi-field matching (phone, email, website, ABN, name+suburb)
- Confidence scoring based on matching field weights
- Recommendation generation (merge, mark_duplicate, investigate)
- Performance-optimized duplicate queries

### Priority Scoring Algorithm

**Factors Considered:**
- Age of submission (aging penalty/boost)
- AI confidence levels (lower confidence = higher priority)
- Recommendation type urgency (reject > manual_review > approve)
- Business verification status (ABN verified, claimed businesses)
- Category value assessment (medical, legal, financial prioritized)
- Quality score thresholds and completeness levels

**Value Assessment:**
- **High Value:** Complete profiles, verified ABN, high-value categories
- **Medium Value:** Partial completion, some verification, standard categories
- **Low Value:** Incomplete profiles, unverified, low-priority categories

**Risk Assessment:**
- **High Risk:** Multiple high-severity issues, spam indicators, duplicates
- **Medium Risk:** Some data quality issues, moderate legitimacy concerns
- **Low Risk:** Clean profiles with minor or no issues
