- Prevents duplicate entries using sophisticated matching algorithms
- Provides comprehensive preview mode to test before actual import

**Real-world scenario:**
> "An admin receives a CSV file with 500 Melbourne businesses from a partner organization. Instead of manually entering each business over several days, they upload the CSV, review the automatic field mapping suggestions, run a preview to catch any data issues, then import all 500 businesses in under 10 minutes with complete error reporting and zero duplicates."

**Technical Excellence:**
- Handles files up to 10,000+ businesses
- Memory-efficient processing prevents server overload
