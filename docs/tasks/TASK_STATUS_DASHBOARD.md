- **Task #6** can run independently (analytics focus)  
- **Task #7** can run independently (bulk operations focus)
- Final two tasks can run in parallel for rapid completion

### **Risk Assessment**
- **🟢 Low Risk**: All major blocking risks now resolved
- **🟢 Low Risk**: Task #4 has clear requirements and foundation
- **🟢 Low Risk**: Tasks #5, #6 can run parallel to reduce timeline risk
- **🟢 Low Risk**: Task #7 remains optional enhancement

## 🚨 **CURRENT BLOCKERS & RISKS**

### **Active Blockers** 🔴
None - Final remaining tasks (Tasks #6, #7) are unblocked and ready to begin implementation

### **Potential Risks** ⚠️
1. **CLI Integration**: Task #4 CLI-to-Web bridge may require additional API enhancements
2. **AI System Complexity**: Task #5 AI integration may reveal system optimization needs  
3. **Resource Allocation**: Multiple parallel tasks may require coordination
4. **Scope Creep**: Additional analytics or automation requirements may emerge

### **Mitigation Strategies** 🚫️
1. **Phased Development**: Complete core functionality before advanced features
2. **Foundation Stability**: Tasks #2, #3 completion provides stable foundation
3. **Parallel Execution**: Leverage multiple unblocked tasks to reduce timeline
4. **Incremental Delivery**: Deploy features as they're completed
