## 🎯 **DEPENDENCY OVERVIEW**

### **Dependency Types**
- 🔴 **Hard Dependency**: Task cannot begin without completion of prerequisite
- 🟡 **Soft Dependency**: Task can begin but requires prerequisite for full functionality  
- 🟢 **Parallel Opportunity**: Tasks can execute simultaneously without conflict
- ⚠️ **Resource Conflict**: Tasks compete for same development resources

## 📈 **DEPENDENCY RISK ANALYSIS**

### **Critical Path Risks** 🔴
1. **Task #2 Delays**: Blocks 80% of remaining work
   - **Mitigation**: Focus all resources on Task #2 completion
   - **Alternative**: Implement minimal API stubs to unblock UI development

2. **Task #3 Complexity**: May extend timeline and block Task #4
   - **Mitigation**: Start with core components, defer advanced features
   - **Alternative**: Build UI shell first, integrate APIs incrementally

### **Resource Risks** 🟡
1. **Single Developer Limitation**: Cannot fully leverage parallel opportunities
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize high-impact tasks, defer enhancements
   - **Alternative**: Consider contractor support for specific tasks

2. **Integration Complexity**: API-UI integration may require rework
   - **Mitigation**: Early prototype testing during API development
   - **Alternative**: Mock APIs for early UI development

### **Scope Risks** 🟢
1. **Feature Creep**: Additional requirements may emerge
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain strict scope control, defer enhancements
   - **Alternative**: Document future enhancements for separate planning

## 🛠️ **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT TOOLS**

### **Progress Tracking**
- **TASK_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md**: Real-time progress visibility
- **MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md**: Detailed subtask tracking
- Weekly dependency review meetings

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Early Integration Testing**: Test API-UI integration during development
- **Incremental Delivery**: Deploy completed phases to reduce integration risk
- **Fallback Planning**: Maintain alternative approaches for blocked tasks

### **Communication**
- **Daily Standups**: Progress updates and blocker identification
- **Weekly Reviews**: Cross-task dependency and timeline assessment
- **Bi-weekly Planning**: Resource allocation and priority adjustments

---

## 📞 **ESCALATION PROCEDURES**

### **Dependency Blocking** 🚨
If a prerequisite task is delayed or blocked:
1. **Immediate**: Notify all dependent task owners
2. **Within 24h**: Assess impact on overall timeline
3. **Within 48h**: Implement mitigation strategy (mocks, stubs, alternative approach)
4. **Weekly**: Review and adjust overall project timeline

### **Resource Conflicts** ⚠️
If multiple tasks compete for same resources:
1. **Prioritize Critical Path**: Task #2 takes precedence over all others
2. **Leverage Parallel Opportunities**: Allocate different resources to parallel tasks
3. **Consider External Resources**: Contractor support for non-critical tasks

### **Scope Changes** 📝
If new dependencies are identified:
1. **Document Impact**: Update this dependency map
2. **Assess Timeline**: Revise project timeline and milestones
3. **Communicate Changes**: Notify all stakeholders of updated dependencies
4. **Update Tracking**: Revise dashboard and checklist documents
